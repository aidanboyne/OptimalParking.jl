In crowded urban areas, attempting to find street parking near your destination can be a stressful and aggravating task.
You might attempt to pull into a spot only to find you lack the space (or skill) to fit in the narrow gap. Even worse,
you might find that inconsiderate drivers have managed to take up 5 potential spots with only three vehicles. Considering
varying vehicle size, perfect use of curb space in a busy environment is unlikley. This project attempts to simulate parking
to find an optimal parking strategy, that if followed, would lead to the most vehicles finding a spot near their destination.
